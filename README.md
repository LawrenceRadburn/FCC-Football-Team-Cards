# Objective
Improve upon DOM manipulation, event handling, switch statemens.
Additionll, I plan to learn about object deconstructuring, data filtering, nested objects, and default parameters.

# Scope
The HTML and CSS files were provided by freeCodeCamp. As a result, I only worked through the JavaScript from scratch.

# What I Learned

## Object.freeze()
You can use the Object.freeze() static method to prevent any changes to be made to the argument. In this case, I added an object as a parameter.
As a result, new properties cannot be addeded to the object in the parameter.

## Object Destructuring
By using the destructuring syntax, const { a, b } = obj; we can assign variables to object properties in one line. This was particularily useful for when I wanted to assign several properties within an object to variables.
